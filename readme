# **Playwright Test Suite**

This repository contains end-to-end tests built with Playwright to validate key user interactions on a sample web application. The test suite ensures the functionality of critical workflows, including login, registration, account management, and more.

---

## **Test Scenarios**

### **1. Login Test Suite**

The **Login Test Suite** focuses on testing user authentication workflows, including invalid login attempts and user registration. Key scenarios include:

- **Invalid Login:**  
  Attempts to log in with randomly generated invalid credentials and verifies the display of an appropriate error message.

- **User Registration and Login:**  
  Registers a new user using dynamically generated data, logs out, and logs back in to verify access to the account overview.

### **2. End-to-End Test Suite**

The **End-to-End Test Suite** ensures the functionality of multiple workflows across different pages. Core test scenarios include:

- **Opening a New Savings Account:**  
  Opens a new savings account and verifies its successful creation.

- **Fund Transfers:**  
  Transfers funds from the newly created account to another account and validates the updated balances.

- **Bill Payment:**  
  Simulates bill payment and confirms the transaction reflects in the account balance and is verified via API.

- **Navigation to Global Sections:**  
  Ensures smooth navigation to various sections, including About Us, Services, Admin, and Products, with correct content display.

## **Folder Structure**

The project follows a modular structure for maintainability:

- **`pages/`**: Page Object Models (POM) for different application pages (e.g., `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage`, `HomePage`).
- **`utils/`**: Utility and helper functions (e.g., `PageHelper`, `TestDataHelper`) to simplify repetitive tasks.
- **`api/`**: API utility methods (e.g., `TransactionsApi`) for validating data through backend APIs.

---

## **Dynamic Test Data**

Test data is generated dynamically using the **TestDataHelper** utility. This includes random usernames, passwords, and payee details, ensuring unique test runs without reliance on static data.
